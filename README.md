# Jenkins-CI/CD-EKS 
- This repository is a continuance of the wave-FinalProject repository 
- The text file pre-requistes.txt details the step I used to create the jenkins pipeline
1) After the EKS-cluster is up and running, we will install jenkins on the master node and configure it
2) Install docker on master-jenkins and make sure awscli,eksctl,kubectl are installed and configured
3) we will need to install the Docker,Docker pipeline and Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin.
4) create creadential for docker hub 
5) create creadential for kubernetes cluster 
6) create a pipeline in Jenkins and build it
7) verify the deployments to the cluster

**This steps are a continuance for the repository wave-FinalProject**
